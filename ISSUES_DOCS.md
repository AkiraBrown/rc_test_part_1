# How To Organise Issues on Github Issues

In the process of creating an Issue on Github there are some key standards established for us to follow so that we make sure problems are well communicated and there's clarity in each issue we create.

### 1. The Title

When creating a title for the issue we want to stick with best commit linting practice. This looks like:

`Bug(server/app.js): incorrect configuration of CORS`

In this example we apply a tag `Bug` and specify the location of where the issue is `(server/app.js)`.We follow up with a small summarised description of the problem so that it's easier to read on our github issues log.

### 2. The Description

With the description section the better we can explain the problem the easier it is to find a solution, so we'll use some questions to address the problem and how it can be fixed.

- What is the issue?
- Why does it matter?
- How does it Occur?
- Who is affected?
- When did this occur or could this happen?
- How did you approach the research?
- How did you validate your hypothesis?
- How can we prevent this from happening in the future?
- How can we anticipate similar problems?

Also provide a sources section at the end.
